Running the Game:

1. This game is written in Python. For best running purposes, run using  Python3 (any version should do).
2. *** Before running, see below for python packages to install
3. The main file to run is the run_game.py. 
4. Once run_game.py has been run, the comamnd prompt will ask you for a username input. Use only lowercase letters. The username will allow you to save progress (once a trial has been completed, you will see a json file corresponding to the username. This is where the game data is stored for future use).
5. To exit the game, hit the escape button or q. Might have to hit a few times. Do not worry if sound keeps playing, it will continue to play then terminate.
6. Packages to install in order to run the game:
